## Portfolio Website v 1.2.0

### My first portfolio project that I created using a bootstrap templatemo theme.

1. I read and hard-coded the initial example in order to learn more about `mobile-first designs`
2. I changed the content and reorganized the initial setup.
3. Seperated each section and then created `original` sections with my own `HTML` & `CSS`
4. This was my second installment of my original portfolio design which didn't feature any JS or CSS frameworks.
5. After learning more about web development I made several changes and implemented more _tools and libraries_.
6. The dev branch was created in order to refactor the code into a React App.
7. My Portfolio v 2 was created and i've left this repo here to document my growth as a _Web Developer_.
